# 🍷 Wine Quality and Classification

This project focuses on classifying and predicting wine quality based on several chemical properties and other features. The dataset includes various attributes like acidity, alcohol content, sulfur dioxide levels, and more. The goal is to predict the **"label"** of wine (which could represent its quality or type) using machine learning models.

## 📊 Features

- ✅ Chemical features of wine such as acidity, sugar content, alcohol level, etc.
- ✅ Target: **'label'**, which represents the wine’s classification (either quality or wine type)
- ✅ Models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Regression models for predicting quality

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes the following columns:

- **Features**:
    - `fixed acidity`
    - `volatile acidity`
    - `citric acid`
    - `residual sugar`
    - `chlorides`
    - `free sulfur dioxide`
    - `total sulfur dioxide`
    - `density`
    - `pH`
    - `sulphates`
    - `alcohol`
    - `quality`

- **Target**:
    - `label`: This column represents the classification of wine, which can either be its quality rating (e.g., a scale of 0–10) or the type of wine (red or white).

> **Note**: The **target label** can be a numeric score (if it's quality) or a binary class (if it's red/white wine classification).

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repo:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/wine-quality-classification.git
cd wine-quality-classification

    Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

    Run the main script:

python wine_classification.py

    Results:

    A trained machine learning model will be saved in the model/ directory

    Evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score) will be printed to the console

📦 Output

    model/: Folder containing the saved trained models

    predictions.csv: File containing the model’s predictions for test data

    Evaluation metrics displayed in the terminal
